# Eco-Route
Eco-Route is a mobile application that offers users a tool to calculate their personal transportation carbon emissions, monitor their progress over time, and discover ways to decrease their emissions.
# Background Story
The background problem that inspired the creation of this app is related to the significant increase in CO2 emissions over the years. In 1950, the world emitted 6 billion tonnes of CO2, and by 1990, it had surpassed 22 billion tonnes. Currently, the annual emissions have risen to over 34 billion tonnes. Notably, Asia is responsible for 53% of the global emissions. According to secondary data, approximately 16.2% of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide originate from the Transportation Sector, with road-going vehicles contributing 11.9% out of the 16.2%.

Carbon emissions have far-reaching impacts on the environment, health, and the economy. To address the aforementioned background problem, Eco-Route was developed as a solution. Eco-Route is an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize the way we approach personal transportation and its environmental impact. By leveraging advanced technologies such as machine learning, mobile development, and cloud computing, Eco-Route provides users with a comprehensive tool to predict, track, and optimize their carbon emissions simply by entering vehicle data into the app.
